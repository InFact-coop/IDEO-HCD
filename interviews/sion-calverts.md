## interview with sion whellens - june 9 2017

### Q1 how would you go about hiring new employees?

- nowadays mostly social media
- before the web, mostly print press
- active positive discrimination by signalling that minorities welcome
- targetting for example "black" press
- never made a big deal of the fact that the organisation is a coop
- recruiting for employees or trainees, always with the intention of trainees or paid interns becoming members
- no traditional apprenticeships
- at the moment, existing employees have been around a long time and are experts (no junior staff) and trainees would jave to skill up quickly
- application process consists of a cover letter and CV
- interview process - usually half a dozen candidates - 2 stage process
- first interview: informal discussion (some talk about cooperative values), no expectation that people fully understand the values of a coop, main intent is to look for smart people / not assholes;
- no explicitly stated policies; policies are communicated through culture; employees are expected to live up to the culutural expectations. Sion identifies that the fact that they are not super explicit could be a problem.

### Q2: how would you go about tackling the problem of diversity nowadays?
- when recruiting juniors, target mostly schools - admits that pool of candidates even in schools is not very diverse
- assumes that through history / own diversity, minorities will feel welcome
- however, not making a consciious effort any more
- in the last 3 years, only 2 new recruits (so not much recent experience)

### Q3: do you think your industry is suitable for people with disabilities (not thining about accessibility of building)?
- so many types of disability
- once had an applicant HIV positive who disclosed this at first interview
- buildings are a problem, as accessible buildings are more expensive; it wouldn't be inconceivable to build a lift, but current premises are rented and not long term so this would probably be too big an investment
- sometimes disabled clients needs to visit and so special arrangements have to be made
- finishing processes in printing industry involve lots of hand work, which is manual and repetitive; subcontractors often employ disabled people. Good sight and colour recognition are crucial. Machine minders need to be able bodied. For designers, this is a different matter.
- If a designer came forward and was the right candidate, they would do everything they could to get that person on board and improve accessibility
- work with peace pledge organisation making poppies - explicitly employ disabled people
- have also worked with action for blind people (creating work opportunities for people with visual impairments)

### Q4: experience of recruiting disabled employees...
- only one person ever employed who is registered disabled (as opposed to self-described)
- recruited as designer and known to group
- HIV positive
- worked for 6 years
- he "did something really bad" and was dismissed
- employee claimed unfair dismissal on the grounds of his disability, gender and sexual orientation
- sion says this was money driven
- they were forced to ask themselves whether they discriminate
- sought professional advice from a solicitor
- as a coop, risk is much higher as employment tribunals have to understanding of the cooperative model (with clear boss-employee relationship)
- coops frequently settle outside of court as low risk
- calverts decided to fight on principle; the employee then withdrew the claim after calverts threathened to make a counter claim

### Q5: any reservations about hiring disabled people in the future?
- employers do discriminate
- potentially because of their own liabilities
- also applies to young women (likely to have children)
- companies are supposed to train staff to avoid discrimination, but this is rarely done properly
- if companies do everything properly, the employer is less likely to be found liable for instances of discrimination
- fear of discrimination would not be a factor in calverts' thinking - they are actively trying to be more open towards people with disabilities


## Q6: any particular disabilities?
- learning difficulties maybe a problem, because of fast learning environment
- because all employees are members and directors, it is essential that new recruits can grasp this concept
- have employed people with "borderline" cognitive disorders in the past, e.g. OCD
- also long-term health issues not classed as disabilities
- as  long-term employer, long term health problems have to be dealt with; have a "culture of care"
- no policies in terms of qualities people have to have in order to employ someone for a job
- the working environment is not a "natural", not everyone would cope and the model could be seen as discriminative
- everyone is paid the same so performance is important
- sion can envision a more creative enviroment where labour is not wage-driven where people can make different contributions, and this would be more accommodating
- can "certainly see us working with" certain people on an outsource basis, e.g. photographers or illustrators who are not employees but just collaborators; these people define their own pace to a much greater extent

## more stuff...
- when looking for people, he would prefer to go through a self-help or campaigning organisation that a charity
- doesn't want efforts to look like charity
- applies to getting black people / women / gay people into the printing industry (calverts were among the first to hire beyond standard white male pool of candidate)
