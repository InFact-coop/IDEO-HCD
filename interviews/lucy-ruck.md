# interview with lucy ruck, 19.06.2017

## 1: what's your job at the BDF

tech taskforce manager overseeing everything to do with the taskforce within BDF.

Taskforce is dedicated to making the tech world a more accessible place. (and she'll send us a better description by email!)

### How long have you been doing this?

Just over 3 years.

#2: in what ways do you engage with disabled people?

People don't always indentify as having a disability so that's not an easy question. Don't always know whether a person is disabled or how. That makes work more interesting. It's not about disability, it's about how to make things work for people.
Speaking as someone with an impairment, that makes my work more interesting.

#3: what experiences have you had with employer initiatives to tackle inequality in the workplace?

That's huge.
Doesn't tie in with role in taskforce, but candidates are sometimes not even able to go to an interview because of their requirements, or the stereotypes / prejudices of the employer.
Employers sometimes don't know how to help / communicate. They may think they're doing the right thing by not bringing someone into an interview when they believe they're not suitable for the job anyway.
Gap in unemployment between able and disabled people is huge.
We too often find excuses why we can't employ a disabled person.
50% of people employed at Nasa have dyslexia (fact check!). Some disabilities may bring an advantage to certain jobs.
People with disabilities are often great problem solvers and planners. Famous people with disabilities, e.g. richard branson has dyslexia - to which he often attributes his success.

Workplace adjustments: e.g. person with visual impairment. Case study:
Lloyds banking group changing the system of adjusting the workplace to be suited to individuals.
Sometimes people are expected to prove their disability on medical grounds. Lloyds changed this by not requiring medical evidence. Special pot of money put aside for extra equipment. Workload / budget management taken away from line manager. This allowed them to make savings, turnaround for hiring new employees brought down from 3 months to 12 days -- check stats in case study!!
Benefits for employee and employer (productivity, feeling valued).
Shell have done something similar on a global level.
Diversity is often treated as one whole (including LGBT, culture), but disability is a physical barrier. It's not *just* about stereotypes or perception (although this is an additional barrier). Tools (such as screen reader software) can even the playing field and make taking a job possible. Without these tools people are at a complete disadvantage.

## 4 any industries where you think people would do better or worse?

Anyone with a disability can work in any area if they have the skills / talent. But some disabilities go better with some industries, but we have to be careful about cliches (e.g. autism and coding or numbers). We have to be careful about putting people into boxes.
Barclays bank have publicly declared that they want to be the most accessible company in the FTSE 100. There are no industries that we can look at as a whole.
Channel 4 have also done a lot for disability in terms of their broadcasting. Also paralympics. This is interesting for everyone, disabled or not.

## 5 any particular experiences within the tech industry?

It comes down to the culture of the company specifically. At my company, people are really eager to make adjustments and to bring in a wide range of people with different skillsets. We have one person with a visual impairment and one with dyslexia and when they work together the one with dyslexia works more with the diagrams and the other one works more with the text.
For example, Microsoft have done hiring around people with autism. This started off via a CTA on Twitter. They opened up hackathon events specifically for this group. In the end too many candidates came forward and not everyone could be interviewed.
We say targeted recruitment is great (shows that people are welcome, sends a positive message), but it's *more* effective if people with a disability can apply through the regular recruitment channels.

## 6 suggestions for improvement for other employers
Advice for companies: do a full audit on the recruitment process. Look at job descriptions in detail, language can put people off. If application is online, is there an alternative format? Can candidates use their own devices in tests? Are you doing enough for applicants? (quite often, this isn't the case)
What does your company website look like? Are you including photos of lots of different people, e.g. people with a disability or a guide dog. It's more about the feel or a website, a subtle element of branding that sends a positive message. Let people know if you have a network for e.g. women, LGBT, disabilities.

## 7 what kind of reservations do you think an employer might have?

Scope campaign called [End the Awkward](https://www.scope.org.uk/end-the-awkward). Alex  has done great short films. Demystifies how to talk to people with disability. People feel awkward about disability and don't know what to do. Rather than doing something about it, they hide away.
It's good to have a conversation and ask them how they want to be referred to, e.g. do you prefer deaf or hearing impaired? It's best to be upfront and people will tell you what they do or don't like.
Most disabled people I've met are quite upfront because they have to be.
Quite often the adjustments that need to be made are not that major, e.g. a bowl of water for the guide dog.

## 8: first hand experience of this?

Work with over 300 organisations to make the disability smart, focus on procedure and culture. Open culture where people can talk about their disability. Subtle. What works for one person doesN#t work for another.

Inevitably, you always get bad managers and we constantly need to tackle that and support those managers to empathize with individuals. They don't want to be bad managers.

## 9: what if a disabled person is not open about their disability?

We've moved away from the term disclosure because it has negative implications. Instead we talking about 'telling' about or 'talking' about a disability because that's more conversational.
Some people are reluctant to talk about their disability because they've had negative experiences in the past. This can make it difficult for organisations to help and support them and it can be frustrating for everyone involved.
Most people are not born disabled, it's something they acquire. They may be coming to terms with it and they may not yet need much help. How and when to decide to tell somebody is not the same for everyone.
Same for mental health, e.g. anxiety. What if someone is having suicidal thoughts in the workplace? We need to help people by creating a culture where people can talk about and share their experiences.

A lot of people who we think fall under the disabled label hate it and don't identify as disabled. It's about how people self-identify. It doesn't always need a label.

## 10: what would you hope to see in the future?

Culture is the key thing. Process, procedure and policy is all important but we need a culture where people feel welcomed. We need to treat individuals with respect. Understanding why positive discrimination is necessary, e.g. extra time in exams or having a special parking space.
